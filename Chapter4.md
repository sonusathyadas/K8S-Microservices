## Working with DockerHub
In the previous chapter you deployed your containerized applications using the `docker-compose` tool. Now, we are going to deploy our containerized applications on the **Microsoft Azure** cloud. We use the `Azure Kubernetes Service` for this. But, before deploying the application on the AKS cluster, you need to upload your application images to a publicly accessible repository. You can now use the free, public repository - [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) for this. In this chapter, we will be uploading our containerized application images to the `Docker hub`.

### Prerequisites
* Docker Desktop
* Visual Studio Code
* Docker extension for VS Code 
  
### DockerHub
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. 
> Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository in which Docker users and partners create, test, store and distribute container images. Through Docker Hub, a user can access public, open source image repositories, as well as use a space to create their own private repositories, automated build functions, webhooks and work groups.
>  *source: [https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/Docker-Hub)*

Docker hub provides the following major features:
- *Repositories*: Push and pull container images.
- *Teams & Organizations*: Manage access to private repositories of container images.
- *Official Images*: Pull and use high-quality container images provided by Docker.
- *Publisher Images*: Pull and use high-quality container images provided by external vendors. Certified images also include support and guarantee compatibility with Docker Enterprise.
- *Builds*: Automatically build container images from GitHub and Bitbucket and push them to Docker Hub
- *Webhooks*: Trigger actions after a successful push to a repository to integrate Docker Hub with other services.

### Create an account in Docker Hub

1. Open the browser and navigate to [http://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)
2. Sign up for a new account
3. In the signup page provide a valid `docker id`, `password` and `email` address. Confirm and create the user.
4. Provide the user details to complete the registration. You will receive a confirmation mail in the given email address. 
5. Goto you email account and click on the link in the confirmation mail to activate your account.

### Login to the `Docker Hub` for pusing images
1. Open the `Command prompt/Terminal` and run the following command.
    > $ docker login
2. This will ask you to enter your user name (`docker id`) and docker password. Your can provide the `docker id` and `password` you have used to create the Docker Hub account.
    ```
    λ docker login
    Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
    Username: azuredeveloper
    Password:
    Login Succeeded
    ```
    > **Note:** Password will not appear when you type it. It hides the password for security. 
### Push your `IdentityAPI` service image to Docker Hub
> **Note:** Make sure you have installed the `Docker Desktop` software in your machine successfully.

1. Open the `Command prompt/Terminal` and set `K8S-Microservices/IdentityAPI/IdentityAPI` folder as the current working directory.
2. You can see the `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` file in the directory. 
3. You need to build the image with the name that contains your `docker id`. You can tag your Docker image in the following format.
    > &lt;dockerid&gt;/image:tag
    > eg: azuredeveloper/identityapi:latest
4. Run the following command to build the image. 
    > $ docker build -t &lt;dockerid&gt;/identityapi:latest .
    > **Note:** Replace the &lt;dockerid&gt; with your docker id your have created. Do not forget to put the . (dot ) at the end of the command line.
    ```
    λ docker build -t azuredeveloper/identityapi .

    ```
5. Run the `docker images` command to see the list of images.
    ```
    λ docker images
